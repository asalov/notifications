# Notifications

A notifications component built with Vue.js

## Mock API
The mock back-end is created using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). You need to have it installed globally in order to successfully run the project. This can be done with the following command:

```
npm install -g json-server
```

Then, you can start up the API, by running this command from the root project directory:
```
json-server --watch db.json
```

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm start

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
